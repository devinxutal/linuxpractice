fancy functions are supported:

* Easy control, user can control the cube by simply flicking the cube and black area. control buttons are also supported to provide another way to control the cube. Zoom in/out are supported by control buttons.

* Cube solution at any time, and Fancy Cube can demonstrate the solution with an interactive 3D animation.
 
* Solve a real cube. Fancy Cube can capture a real cube using camera and image recognition technology, then solve it in either simple or interactive way. Beginners can solve their own cube with Fancy Cube!

* Cube algorithm viewer. currently Fridrichs CFOP algorithm are embedded in Fancy Cube. every algorithm can be demonstrated in 3D animation.

[Cube Control]

TURN: flick the cube along any side corner, or edge to turn that face in a particular direction.\n\n

ROTATE: to rotate the whole cube, just flick the cube in any black area. in some particular situation that cube turning is disabled, flicking the cube in ANY area leads to a cube rotation.

OTHER: you can unfold the control pad (click the icon in the upper left corner of the screen) to get a easier control over the cube. Here you can zoom in/out the cube and rotate it.
