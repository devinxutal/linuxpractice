    <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p>Go Jewels is a little bit like the popular game Bejeweled but with different consideration 
	and more fun. it is well designed for android platform so sure you will love it! Go jewels is 
	also integrated with <a href="http://community.scoreloop.com/"><b>Scoreloop</b></a> to provide 
	<b>Global High Scores</b>. You can submit your score and compare with your friends.
	</p>
	
    <a href="#" name="how_to_play"></a>
	<h2>2. HOW TO PLAY</h2>
	<p>The target of Go Jewels is to swap adjacent jewels (horizontal & vertical) to form a combination
	of three or more jewels in same type. It can be played with simple tap-flip operations. You just tap 
	the screen to select one jewel and flip it with adjacent jewels, or tap twice to select two jewels.
	the valid combinations will be eliminated and proper score points will be granted.
	After removing jewels, new jewels drop down to the playground. Quite often the falling jewels
    create new valid combinations, causing a continuous elimination, which
    grants you more points. the number of combinations eliminated after one swap is calculated as COMBO.
    And the length of one combination is calculated as CHAIN.</p>

    <a href="#" name="scoring"></a>
    <h2>3. SCORING</h2>
	<p>One basic chain-3 combination (a combination with three jewels) makes 10 pts.
	and each additional jewel makes 20 more pts. That means, a chain-5 combination makes
	10 + (5 - 3) * 20 = 50 pts.</p>
    
	<p>If combos exist, each additional combo makes 30 pts. For example, if three chain-3 
	combination are formed after swapping. these combinations will make 10, 40 and 70 pts.</p>
    
    <p>There is another parameter called BONUS, which will be multiplied in score calculation. 
    Using the above example, if the BONUS is 3X. the score points will be 30, 120, 210 pts.</p>
    
    <a href="#" name="game_modes"></a>
    <h2>4. GAME MODES</h3>
    <a href="#" name="normal"></a>
    <h3>Normal Mode</h3>
    <p>In normal mode, You can continue playing until there is no more possible swaps.</p>
    <a href="#" name="timed"></a>
    <h3>Timed Mode</h3>
	<p>In timed mode, You have 90 seconds to play the game, and each elimination will make 
	some time bonus. That means your remaining time will be prolonged. There is a progress bar
	just above the playground. Once the bar reaches zero, there is no time left and the
    game is over.</p>
	
	<p>Spotting valid moves quickly and creating COMBOs is the key to the success in the TIMED
    mode.</p>
    
	<a href="#" name="quick"></a>
	<h3>Quick Mode</h3>
	<p>Quick mode is much alike Timed mode, You have 90 seconds to play the game, but eliminations
	have no effect on remaining time. There is a progress bar
	just above the playground. Once the bar reaches zero, there is no time left and the
    game is over.</p>
	
	<a href="#" name="infinite"></a>
	<h3>Infinite Mode</h3>
	<p>This mode is same as the normal mode, except that when there are no more swaps to make, the game
	refills the board with fresh jewels.</p>
	
	<p>Do note that there are no high scores kept for the infinite mode, as it would be pretty much
	pointless to do so.</p>
